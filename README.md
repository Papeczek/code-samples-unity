# code-samples-unity

## This repository contains selected code samples from a Unity project I’ve been working on – a top-down action game built using C# and Unity.

These scripts were written by me and cover a variety of gameplay features, including:

-Player movement & input

-Enemy behavior

-UI logic

-Game state management

-Custom systems & interactions
